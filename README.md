# COOT

Python3 implementation of the paper [CO-Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03731) (NeurIPS 2020)

CO-Optimal Transport (COOT) is an Optimal Transport problem between measures whose supports do not necessarily live in the same metric space. It aims to simultaneously optimize two transport maps between both samples and features of two datasets with possibly different number of rows and columns.

Feel free to ask if any question.
